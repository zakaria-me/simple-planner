# Webplanner

This a very basic webplanner front app with no DB support. I wrote it to familiarize myself with JS events management.

# How to use

```
mkdir webplanner
cd webplanner/
git clone https://github.com/zakaria-me/simple-planner.git
```

Then use your favorite web browser to open the app.
